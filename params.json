For this reason please treat the code as illustrative only. Should you want to launch a production-quality service on the API please use the REST end-points directly.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the Google Suverys API, check out the [Google Surveys API developer site](https://developers.google.com/surveys/).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n# Contents\r\n\r\n- `client_libraries-DEPRECATED`: C#, Java, and Python client libraries that are\r\n  deprecated and no longer maintained.
